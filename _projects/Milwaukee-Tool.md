## Summary

The company, a large power tool manufacturer based in Milwaukee, WI., had a strong brand presence but a fractured digital team. The iOS and Android apps had been designed for iOS and then “ported” to Android. Android was receiving a lot of negative feedback, as it lacked consistency to other Android apps. 

I worked with Milwaukee Tool for sixteen months. Using their existing branding as a basis, I built a WCAG Level AA Compliant living style guide. I then leveraged Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design to separate the one app style into two distinct native applications. Our team then used our style guide to iterate through new features quickly.

## Process
### Design Partnership with Marketing
The ONE-KEY apps were incredibly red — it was hard to differentiate sliders, buttons and text. Marketing wanted to convey the same sense of innovation, quality and heavy-duty equipment that was on the rest of the website. Unfortunately, the overuse of made the app less inclusive, less readable and overall not very usable. 

I spearheaded a project to propose a new color scheme and typography to maintain the Milwaukee brand while making the app more readable. To further emphasize our point, we analyzed 20 different apps with strong red colors — very few of them had the over-the-top red of Milwaukee's ONE-KEY apps.

Branding and marketing agreed: we needed a slightly refreshed and streamlined look to be successful.

## Results
Customer reviews on the Android app store went up from 2.7 to 3.6 (out of five stars). The iOS application went from a 3.9 to a 4.1.

The initial style guide I developed was adopted not just by our internal team but embraced by the developers. The dev team created a living style and code repository they could leverage in future updates.
