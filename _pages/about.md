I fell into UX on accident, as many of us do. I was a software engineering intern working on a team that mainly supported legacy applications. I knew none of that was right for me, but I didn’t quite know where to go. Volunteering, politics and a startup later, I found what I loved doing. I thrived on making the world around me better.

After a few years in UX, I formalized my education with a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from DePaul in 2015. My interest quickly grew in cognitive psychology and inclusive design. I wanted to understand what motivated people to do the things they did. Then I wanted to help them, help everyone, reach those goals. I thrive on making the world around me better… but for everyone. 

I combine my love of design accessibility and my background in cognitive psychology to build immersive and usable experiences across traditional and emerging technologies.
